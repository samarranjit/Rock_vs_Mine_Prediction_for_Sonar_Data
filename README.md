# 🎯 Sonar Rocks vs Mines Prediction using Logistic Regression

A **machine learning classification project** that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a **rock** or a **mine**. This project implements a **Logistic Regression** model on the classic [Sonar dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)), demonstrating **end-to-end ML workflow** — from data collection and preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction system creation.

## 🔍 Example Prediction

```python
input_data = (0.0117,0.0069,0.0279,...,0.0062,0.0026,0.0052)
```
✅ Output:

```bash
The object is a Rock
```
or,
```bash
The object is a Mine
```
